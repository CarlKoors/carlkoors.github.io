            <h3>Programing</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;Hello my name is Carl, 
                I have been coding since the summer of 2014. 
                It started as a hobby but it slowly evolved into an obsession. 
                I&apos;ve been around block so to speak I first started with HTML & CSS. 
                However, it quickly evolved to: Javascript, C, C# - sharp, and C++ - plus plus. 
                After a few years of making memory cheats for the few video games I played I switched to making discord bots. 
                This required me to learn Python and Nodejs -- for Discord(dot)js. 
                I eventually settled on node. 
                I can say with certainty that “anything that can be written in javascript will be written in javascript” (FireShip).
            </p>
                
            <h3>Athletics</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;Over the last few year I have had a surprising interest in athletics. 
                Especially running, more specifically long distance running. 
                I love the mental strain and the thrill of not knowing how, 
                but that you will make it through the run. 
                Which surprises a lot of people as I used to be a sprinter -- not a very good one, 
                but still a sprinter. Anyway, 
                I switched to distance running my sophomore year after taking up longer distance running during the winter. 
                I can say that I love longer runs for a few reasons: the mental and physical challenges, commitment, and the feeling of completion.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;I like everyone else listens to music, 
                I listen to Rap, Hip-Hop, Pop, Heavy Metal, and even some christian music. 
                That&apos;s a large taste, I just like the flow and rhyming of Rap, the notes of Pop, 
                the energy of Heavy Metal, and the message of christian music.
            </p>
